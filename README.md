# Java-SpringBoot-postgresql-
This is my first ever using Spring Boot + Data JPA + PostgreSQL. I oldy have learned the basics of java so learning all these tools in one night was like a brain bursting task. Still I tried my best to replicate everything myself step by step that was taught in the live session.
Day-3 project using Spring Boot, Data JPA &amp; PostgreSQL
